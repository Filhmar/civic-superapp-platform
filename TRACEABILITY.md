# TRACEABILITY — Reference §10 living verification checklist

One row per Reference §10 entry. Status: ❌ todo · 🟡 built · ✅ verified (pass 1) ·
🔁 re-verified (pass 2: full flow on BOTH tenants — MyDasma `ph-cavite-dasmarinas` and
MySorsogon `ph-sorsogon-sorsogoncity` — with zero per-tenant code branches).

**Pass-2 evidence:** `backend/scripts/verify-e2e.ts` — 106 checks across both tenants,
run twice: against host-run services and against the full `docker compose` stack
(12 service containers + 4 infra) — **106/0 both times**. Mobile: 28 jest tests
(6 suites) including live-backend integration for both tenants, `tsc --noEmit`
clean, `expo export --platform web` builds 36 routes. Grep audits: zero tenant
strings in app/platform code (tenant data lives only in seeds, config rows, and
test inputs).

## Cross-cutting re-verification proofs

| Proof | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| No per-tenant code branches | repo-wide grep: hits only in seed data, tenant-variants.json, test inputs, and a `curSOR-`/`adviSOR-` false positive | 🔁 |
| Module off for one tenant = inert; on for the other = live | transport flipped off for Sorsogon via config append (v↑): 403 + tile hidden there, 200 for MyDasma, restored — run on host AND compose stacks | 🔁 |
| IDs, theme, onboarding, Mayor's Corner from config | DSM-/SOR- prefixes on tickets, resident ids, claim stubs, ORs, AST, SOS; theme = runtime CSS vars; onboarding + executive rendered from fetched config | 🔁 |
| Auth: OTP→JWT, rotation, reuse-theft-kill, offline/429 never logs out, force-update fails open | verify-e2e checks + mobile token-refresh unit tests (transient-vs-dead) + force-update fail-open test | 🔁 |
| Status machines render audited timelines | 311 / e-gov / assistance ladders rendered from `timeline[]` (actor, timestamp, note); illegal transitions 409 | 🔁 |
| Append-only audit log on every status/payment event | `audit_events` collection populated via notification dispatch path | 🔁 |
| `docker compose up` brings the backend up clean | 4 infra + 12 service containers healthy; verify-e2e 106/0 against the compose gateway | 🔁 |
| App boots BOTH tenants purely from config | integration suites assert both bundle ids get correct name/colors/slogan/prefix from `/v1/config`; app renders exclusively from that payload; dev boot via `EXPO_PUBLIC_TENANT_BUNDLE_ID` | 🔁 |

## M9 — Admin plane, asset pipeline, consoles (added post-MVP-goal)

| Proof | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchical authz: platform sees all tenants, tenant admin exactly one | verify-e2e admin section + both panel smokes | 🔁 |
| Cross-tenant writes 403; module toggles platform-only 403 for tenant admins | verify-e2e + tenant-panel read-only modules page | 🔁 |
| Admin/resident token planes mutually unusable | separate JWT_ADMIN_* secrets; verify-e2e 401 checks | 🔁 |
| Brand-asset pipeline: presign → MinIO → EXIF-strip/SVG-sanitize → config version → app payload → 200 | verify-e2e (seal URL 200) + mobile integration test (photo URL 200) + script-stripped SVG diff | 🔁 |
| Admin ops replace CLI scripts (audited actor=admin:role:id) | DSM ticket transitioned via /v1/admin, timeline actor recorded | 🔁 |
| Panels containerized and served with the stack | 19-container compose up; headless Chromium smoke vs :8090/:8091 (login, data, no cross-tenant leak) | 🔁 |
| Mobile renders admin-uploaded assets, falls back cleanly | 34 mobile tests incl. asset-url policy + live URL 200 | 🔁 |
| Full regression | scripts/verify-e2e.ts vs containerized stack: 115/0 | 🔁 |

## Design fidelity (Claude Design prototypes) + third tenant

| Proof | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Design system extracted from the 3 prototypes | docs/designs/extracted/ (DESIGN_SPEC.md, 114 screen PNGs, tenant marks) | 🔁 |
| App restyled to the design system (Plus Jakarta Sans, gradient header w/ overlap search, floating tab bar w/ raised SOS, pastel tile chips, glow shadows, spec radii) | mobile-application/design-check/*.png vs screens/dasma/*.png — visual loop, verified side-by-side | 🔁 |
| Deliberate deviations kept (coming-soon tiles, settings/FAQ per §10, ₱20 added to total — prototype shows it un-added) | DESIGN_SPEC notes + code review | 🔁 |
| MyLegazpi onboarded as tenant #3 with ZERO platform-code change (admin API + Mayon SVG via asset pipeline + seed data) | config v2 w/ seal URL; only seeds/test-inputs/tenant-variants.json changed | 🔁 |
| Full regression across THREE tenants | scripts/verify-e2e.ts: 166 passed, 0 failed vs container stack | 🔁 |
| Platform Console restyled to its Claude Design prototype (indigo operator system, JetBrains Mono machine strings, provision-tenant drawer wired to POST /v1/admin/tenants, designed transition dialogs) | docs/designs/extracted-console/ (spec + 25 screens) vs backend/apps/platform-admin-panel/design-check/ — visual loop; smoke 14/14; containerized smoke :8090 | 🔁 |
| City Console restyled to its Claude Design prototype with ALL tenant colors derived at runtime from config.brand.colors (prototype's own darken/tint formulas) | docs/designs/extracted-city-console/ (spec + 22 screens) vs backend/apps/tenant-admin-panel/design-check/ — Legazpi 1:1 match AND same build renders MyDasma green (20-dasma-dashboard.png); smoke 10/10; containerized smoke :8091 | 🔁 |
